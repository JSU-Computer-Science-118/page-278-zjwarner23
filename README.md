# Page 278 - Sentinel-Controlled while loop

## Program Description:

The program in Example 5-3 computes and outputs the total number of boxes of cookies sold, the total money made, and the average number of boxes sold by each student. However, the program assumes that the programmer knows the exact number of volunteers. 
Now suppose that the programmer does not know the exact number of volunteers. 
Assume that the data is in the following form: **`studentâ€™s name` followed by a space the `number of boxes sold by the student`**.
Because we do not know the exact number of volunteers, we assume that reading a value of **`-1`** for name will mark the end of the data, 
since it is a highly unlikely name to run into. Then the last line is going to be the **`cost of one box`**.
Your input is going to be formatted as shown below.
```
Amari	4
-1
3.50
```
**Please make sure your code's output is exactly the same as the output below.**
